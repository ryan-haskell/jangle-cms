### Scripts

The `package.json` contains all the scripts used for local development and production builds.

Here are some of the most common commands:
- `npm start` - Runs `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- `npm run dev` - Spins up the app, test suite, Storybook, and CSS codegen
- `npm run build` - Runs CSS codegen and `elm-land build`
- `npm run test` - Runs test suite once
